# pyrpg
A Text Based RPG created in Python

This was the produce of a couple of hours messing around with Python. Some things i would like to add if i decide to put more time into it
   - Unit Tests
   - Extract Text rendering into reuseable methods that provide differentiation betwen character dialog and game messages
   - Improve 'critical' calculation. 
   - Improve story flow
   - Implement a 'flee' mechanic 

## Playing
To execute pyrpg use ``python game.py``
